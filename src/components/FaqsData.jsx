        To download the Scoot app, you can search “Scoot” in both the App and
        Google Play <br /> stores. An even simpler way to do it would be to
        click the relevant link at the bottom of <br /> this page and you’ll be
        re-directed to the correct page.

        Yes, please do! All cities have different laws. But we strongly strongly
        strongly recommend <br /> always wearing helmet regardless of the local
        laws. We like you and we want you to be as <br /> safe as possible while
        Scooting.

    question: "Do I need a license to ride?",
    answer: (

        Yes you need a license to ride depends on the context. If you are
        referring to driving a car <br /> or motorcycle on public roads, then
        valid driver's license is typically required. However, <br /> if you are
        talking about riding a bicycle, no license is generally needed.
